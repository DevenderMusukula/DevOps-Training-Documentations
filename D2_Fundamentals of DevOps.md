**1)	Why DevOps?**

**2)	What is DevOps?**

**3)	DevOps Strategies/Methodologies**

Issues might be
1.	Supported Libraries / Missing libraries
2.	OS versions (dev – version 8.1, ops -  version 10)
3.	Software Version issue

Also, the issue for delay might be because developer handed over code to testing and somehow managed to pass testing and when went for QA it fails.

That is how we will see how further **docker** came into picture to build the application.

Because of using Docker file/image the dependencies issues get resolved


**Main Issues Before DevOps**


1)	Dev team Vs Ops team (Blame game )
2)	All is manual process 
3)	Time consuming process

**What is WaterFall Model? Phases of WaterFall Model (MindMap).**

**Stages of Waterfall Model**

![image](https://github.com/DevenderMusukula/DevOps-Training-Documentations/assets/119439237/f13b8e1c-57fb-4ab3-839d-5cd835dd1c73)

**Blue Print -->** Design model which shows how the application interface looks like i.e; Login page, Registration page, Connections, databases etc, each and every single detail here.

**Monitoring:** monitor application health and server.

**Drawbacks of WaterFall Model**

1)	Unless and until one stage or one phase completes, you cannot proceed with next phase.
2)	Time Consuming.
3)	Not suitable for Dynamic approach once application is Live.
4)	No Feedback – until you finish the application, you cannot show it to the client.


**What is Agile Model?**

We have broken down the software into various iterations. i.e;  separate phase for Planning, Design, Development, Testing, QA, Deploy

Planning and Designing: period is 2 to 8 weeks.

**Drawbacks of Agile Model**

1)	Operations teams were unable to catch up the speed with Development team, which is constant conflict.
2)	Again the blame game exists.
3)	Hampering the release goal.

**DevOps Methodology / Approach**

Combination of Development & Operation made as one team called DevOps.
We have mitigated the dev and ops team here, single team who takes care of development and operations team.

This doesn’t mean Ops team need to know coding, but should be able to read the necessary files for app deployment

1)	DevOps engineer deals with

Building
Testing
Quality Assurance (QA)
Deploying
Maintain
Monitoring


2)	Practice / Culture that manages the entire application, following SDLC 

3)	Software development approach

End Goal is to deliver High quality software which will be delivered quickly without any many work / automation with increased reliability 

**Stages or SDLC of DevOps**

DevOps approach consists of various stages

![image](https://github.com/DevenderMusukula/DevOps-Training-Documentations/assets/119439237/e58051f3-ab38-4cf7-812b-8b7fc10599b3)

Aim of DevOps?

1)	Shorten the SDLC

DevOps LifeCycle (How DevOps Symbol Came?)

**Build: Artifact / compilation**

**Continuous Development & CD Tools?**


1)	Planning & Coding of functionality
2)	Git, SVN, JIRA (Login, Register)
3)	Ant, Maven, Gradle etc; (Build & Package the code into executable)


**Continuous Integration & CI tools?**

Jenkins (WebHooks)

**Continuous testing & tools?**

Selenium
JUnit

**Continuous Deployment & tools?**

Configuration tools **-->** Releases deployments to servers

Ansible
Puppet
Chef

**Containerization/Orchestration**

Docker
Kubernetes

**Continuous Monitoring & Tools **

Aim: Quality of software  

Datadog
Dynatrace
CloudWatch
Prometheus
Grafana
